=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dancer;
    use Dancer::Plugin::Chain;

    my $country = chain '/country/:country' => sub {
        # silly example. Typically much more work would 
        # go on in here
        var 'site' => param('country');
    };

    my $event = chain '/event/:event' => sub {
        var 'event' => param('event');
    };

    # will match /country/usa/event/yapc
    get chain $country, $event, '/schedule' => sub {
        return sprintf "schedule of %s in %s\n", map { var $_ } 
                       qw/ event site /;
    };

    my $continent = chain '/continent/:continent' => sub {
        var 'site' => param('continent');
    };

    my $continent_event = chain $continent, $event;

    # will match /continent/europe/event/yapc
    get chain $continent_event, '/schedule' => sub {
        return sprintf "schedule of %s in %s\n", map { var $_ } qw/ event site /;
    };

    # will match /continent/asia/country/japan/event/yapc
    # and will do special munging in-between!

    get chain $continent, 
            sub { var temp => var 'site' },
            $country, 
            sub {
                var 'site' => join ', ', map { var $_ } qw/ site temp /
            },
            $event, 
            '/schedule' 
                => sub {
                    return sprintf "schedule of %s in %s\n", map { var $_ }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implementation of Catalyst-like chained routes. This kind of behavior can
usually be fulfilled by judicious uses of C<prefix>. But hey, diversity is
the spice of life, so there you go.

The plugin exports a single keyword, C<chain>, which creates the chained
routes. 

=head2 KNOWN CAVEATS

The plugin does not support C<prefix> yet, and only support string-based urls
(so no regexes).

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

=head2 chain @chain_items, $coderef

Create a chain out of the items provided, and assign it the final action coderef.

Each chain item can be
a string representing a path segment, a previously defined chain or an
anonymous function. The chain's final path and action will be the aggregate of
its parts. 

For example, the final route declaration of the  SYNOPSIS,

    get chain $continent, 
            sub { var temp => var 'site' },
            $country, 
            sub {
                var 'site' => join ', ', map { var $_ } qw/ site temp /
            },
            $event, 
            '/schedule' 
                => sub {
                    return sprintf "schedule of %s in %s\n", map { var $_ } 
                                qw/ event site /;
            };

would be is equivalent to 

    get '/continent/:continent/country/:country/event/:event/schedule' => sub {
        var 'site' => param('continent');
        var temp => var 'site';
        var 'site' => param('country');
        var 'site' => join ', ', map { var $_ } qw/ site temp /
        var 'event' => param('event');

        return sprintf "schedule of %s in %s\n", map { var $_ } 
                        qw/ event site /;
    }


In scalar context, C<chain> returns its underlying object. 
In list context, it returns a route / action pair of values (). That's how it
can work transparently with C<get>, C<post> and friends.

    # returns the object, that can be used to forge longer chains.
    my $foo_chain = chain '/foo', sub { ... };

    # returns the pair that makes 'get' happy
    get chain $foo_chain;
